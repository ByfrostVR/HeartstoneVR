# HeartstoneVR

## Description
### From wikipedia: [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearthstone_(video_game) "Source")
> "Hearthstone, originally known as Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, is a free-to-play online collectible card video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment.
The game is a turn-based card game between two opponents, using constructed decks of 30 cards along with a selected hero with a unique power. Players use their limited mana crystals to cast spells or summon minions to attack the opponent, with the goal of reducing the opponent's health to zero."

## Our goal:
We want to create full game experience by implementing Heartstone into virtual reality environment by using [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/)(javascript game engine), and [Leapmotion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) to interact with the world. The game will run on the browser.

### Technologies:
 - NodeJS
 - BabylonJS
 - Leapmotion
 - LeapJS
### Currently we managed to:
 - integrate Leapmotion with BabylonsJS
 - create a simple event handling server
