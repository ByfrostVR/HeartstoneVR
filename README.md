# Project "Loki"

## Description
As Loki is the god of mischief, illusions and lies. We, in the "Loki Project" want to create a platform where you can build and interact your own illusionis/virtual world, with as less hardware as we can. Therefore we used Leapmotion, a cheap device which anyone can afford, and we use the phone as a VR device so the platform will be accesible to everyone, and of course - **it's open source!**
## Our goals:
 - [ ] Create a **VR platform** without hardware limitation(without keyboard/mouse/game controller).
 - [ ] Make the platform easy to use, **accesible and affordable**.
 - [ ] Spread our platform to the pulic, and to let them easily integrate their systems with the project(whether its a managment systems, gaming, financial, graphs etc...)

__Using [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/)(javascript game engine), and [Leapmotion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) to interact with the platform -__
