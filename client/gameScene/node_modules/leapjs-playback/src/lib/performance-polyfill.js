// relies on Date.now() which has been supported everywhere modern for years.
// as Safari 6 doesn't have support for NavigationTiming, we use a Date.now() timestamp for relative values

// if you want values similar to what you'd get with real perf.now, place this towards the head of the page
// but in reality, you're just getting the delta between now() calls, so it's not terribly important where it's placed
